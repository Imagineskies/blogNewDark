          <p>It's weird.<br>
            It's painful.<br>
            People think you have to break a bone to feel pain, but that's simply not true. <br>
            Bones, cuts, bruses, those heal. <br>
            Some faster than others, but that will be fixed. <br>
            It's the mental pain that lasts forever. <br>
            I am a girl. <br>
            Yet, unlike girls born one at birth, I don't have breasts, wide hips, a vagina. <br>
            I can't give birth, my voice is deep, I have a Adams Apple. <br>
            I'm built like a man but im not one. <br>
            I know im not one. <br>
            Yet everyday I can't help but be reminded of my pain. <br>
            This was a mistake. <br>
            I, was a mistake. <br>
            By body doesn't match my mind. <br>
            And as time goes on, the pain only gets worse, and worse, and worse. <br>
            I don't shower like others. <br>
            Once every week, every two weeks. <br>
            I wear womens underwear, bra's, dresses, skirts, flannel shirts, cute tops and leggi<br>ngs.
            I wear wigs with different styles and colors. <br>
            Makeup and scents, time and time again, but it's not enough. <br>
            It's not. <br>
            You may think that calling me he, him, son, boy, RaKwan doesn't effect me. <br>
            But for me, this is torture. <br>
            This is pain. <br>
            Overwhelming, distracting, depression inducing pain. <br>
            People love to say, you're faking it or it's just a phase. <br>
            And I don't care if you knew when you were 5 or 15. <br>
            You know when you're trans. <br>
            You get that feeling in your bones. <br>
            That, feeling you get when you know bad things are comming.<br>
            That strike of dysphoria that kills you when you walk, talk...when you awake. <br>
            It makes you shake at the though of people assuming your gender from how you look or don't look. <br>
            Cause I know im a girl, but that's not what I see, what my family see, even what strangers see. <br>
            But the only thing that hurts worse is when you try your hardest to be yourself and everyone ignores that. <br>
            People refuse to see your true self even when you scream it in there face. <br>
            Is this karma? <br>
            Is this payback for everything wrong I've done in life? <br>
            I'll never know the answer. <br>
            But regardless of a reason why, it doesn't go away. <br>
            It stays. <br>
            Life is hard, but when your self-respect is torn away and the weight of the world is then added, you break. <br>
            Then it's up to you to put yourself back together again. <br>
            Not fair is it? <br>
            But yet I still get up, and work on my day the best that I can. <br>
            It's painful, but I numb that pain with hope. <br>
            Hope that one day i'll change this feeling. <br>
            Hope that one day i'll look in the mirror and say to myself "This is me:' Without having to fake it. <br>
            I'll take it. <br>
            Take everything that life throws my way. <br>
            Cause I've been on a war path and I'm just waiting for that day. <br>
            My day. <br>
            I know it will come to me. <br>
            I know it can happen. <br>
            It will happen. <br>
            But in order for me to get the victory, I have to surpass the war. <br>
